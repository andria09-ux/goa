            <p>The Exocoetidae are a family of marine ray-finned fish in the order Beloniformes, known colloquially as
                flying fish or flying cod. About 64 species are grouped in seven genera. While they cannot fly in the
                same way a bird does, flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of the water where their
                long wing-like fins enable gliding for considerable distances above the water's surface. The main reason
                for this behavior is thought to be to escape from underwater predators, which include
                swordfish, mackerel, tuna, and marlin, among others,[6] though their periods of flight expose them to
                attack by avian predators such as frigate birds.</p>

            <p>Barbados is known as "the land of the flying fish" and the fish is one of the national symbols of the
                country. The Exocet missile is named after them, as variants are launched from underwater, and take a
                low trajectory, skimming the surface, before striking their targets.
